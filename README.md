To evaluate search relevancy, companyX has had their searches from a handful of eCommerce websites. A total of 261 search terms were generated, and companyX put together a list of products and their corresponding search terms. Each rater was asked to give a product search term a score of 1, 2, 3, 4, with 4 indicating the item completely satisfies the search query, and 1 indicating the item doesn't match the search term.
